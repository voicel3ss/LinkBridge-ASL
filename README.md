# LinkBridge

LinkBridge is a Flutter accessibility app focused on real-time communication support.

## Vision and Motivation

LinkBridge is designed to support people who experience hearing or vision-related communication barriers in everyday life. The core goal is simple: help users stay independent, informed, and included in conversations and environments that often assume everyone can hear and see clearly.

The app combines multiple accessibility workflows in one place so users do not have to switch tools during daily tasks:
1. Camera-based text recognition with spoken playback for reading signs, menus, and printed information.
2. Live multi-speaker captioning for group conversations.
3. Conversation history for reviewing previously captured speech captions.

The group captioning experience was shaped by a real-world need: tracking who is speaking in fast family or social conversations can be difficult even with hearing support devices. LinkBridge addresses that by labeling speakers and presenting readable, timestamped captions in real time.

For users with visual impairments, the Reader mode converts visible text into speech on demand. This supports day-to-day independence in environments where Braille or accessible signage may not be available.

In short, LinkBridge is built to reduce communication friction, preserve important information, and make it easier for people to remain active participants in school, work, and family life.

At a high level, the app does three things well today:
1. Handles authentication with Firebase (email + password).
2. Runs live multi-speaker audio captioning through a WebSocket backend.
3. Provides assistive reading (camera OCR + text-to-speech) and educational content.

## Current Product Scope (What Users See)

After login, the Home screen exposes 4 tabs:
1. Audio
2. Reader
3. Learn
4. Account

Important note: the old camera sign translator screen is no longer shown in the app navigation.

## What Works Right Now

Working features:
1. Sign up and login with Firebase Authentication.
2. Sign out from the Account tab.
3. Group captioning session start/stop with microphone audio streaming.
4. Session finalization and conversation persistence through backend APIs.
5. Caption history list and conversation detail view.
6. Optional named-speaker identification flow before captioning.
7. Reader tab camera scan with on-device OCR and spoken playback.
8. Learn tab educational content and external links.

Known limitations and in-progress behavior:
1. Share action in caption detail shows a "coming soon" message.
2. Several debug prints are still present in streaming flows.
3. The translator screen code exists in the repository but is intentionally not reachable from Home.
4. Reader mode currently reads text aloud in-session but does not persist OCR scans to history.

## Architecture Overview

### App startup and routing

`lib/main.dart` initializes Firebase, then launches `MaterialApp` with named routes:
1. `/login`
2. `/register`
3. `/home`

### Home shell

`lib/screens/home_screen.dart` uses an `IndexedStack` to preserve tab state while switching between:
1. `GroupCaptioningScreen` (Audio)
2. `TextReaderPage` (Reader)
3. `EducationScreen` (Learn)
4. Account summary/sign-out panel

### Live captioning flow

Primary files:
1. `lib/screens/group_captioning_screen.dart`
2. `lib/screens/speaker_setup_screen.dart`
3. `lib/screens/speaker_identification_screen.dart`
4. `lib/services/conversation_service.dart`
5. `lib/services/caption_review_service.dart`
6. `lib/services/speaker_label_mapper.dart`

How it works:
1. A conversation ID is created via `ConversationService` (`/conversations`) or generated locally if fallback is allowed.
2. The app connects to `wss://aslappserver.onrender.com/speech/ws`.
3. Microphone PCM16 chunks are streamed as base64 `audio_chunk` events.
4. Incoming `final_transcript` events are appended to in-memory captions.
5. On session end, the app sends an `end` event, stops recording, closes the socket, and calls `/speech/finalize`.
6. History screens fetch from `/conversations` and `/conversations/{id}`.

Named-speaker mode:
1. `SpeakerSetupScreen` collects 2-6 names.
2. App opens speech socket in `mode=identifying`.
3. `SpeakerIdentificationScreen` listens for `speaker_detected` and maps backend labels to user names.
4. Speaker registry is posted to `/speech/register_speakers`.
5. Flow transitions into normal captioning mode with pre-connected socket.

### Reader flow

Primary file:
1. `lib/screens/text_reader_page.dart`

How it works:
1. Requests camera permission.
2. Captures a still image from camera preview.
3. Runs OCR using Google ML Kit text recognizer.
4. Speaks recognized text using Flutter TTS.

### Learn and account

Primary files:
1. `lib/screens/education_screen.dart`
2. `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

Behavior:
1. Learn tab presents educational content and opens external resources.
2. Account tab shows current user email and allows sign out.

## Backend Contract Used by the App

Configured host:
1. `https://aslappserver.onrender.com`

Endpoints currently referenced in Flutter code:
1. `wss://aslappserver.onrender.com/speech/ws`
2. `POST /conversations`
3. `GET /conversations`
4. `GET /conversations/{id}`
5. `POST /speech/finalize`
6. `POST /speech/register_speakers`

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Flutter SDK compatible with Dart `^3.10.1`
2. Android Studio (Android builds)
3. Xcode (iOS builds on macOS)
4. Firebase project with Email/Password auth enabled
5. Physical device recommended for camera and microphone testing

Verify local tooling:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Firebase configuration

The app expects `lib/firebase_options.dart` and platform Firebase config files.

Recommended setup using FlutterFire CLI:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

In Firebase Console, enable Email/Password under Authentication.

## Running the App

Android:

```bash
flutter run
```

Choose a specific device:

```bash
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

iOS (macOS only):

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

Web (limited mic/camera behavior):

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Permissions

Runtime permissions used:
1. Microphone (Audio tab and speaker identification)
2. Camera (Reader tab)

If a feature fails unexpectedly, verify OS permissions first.

```

## Troubleshooting

Authentication issues:
1. Re-run `flutterfire configure`.
2. Confirm `firebase_options.dart` matches your project.
3. Ensure Email/Password sign-in is enabled.

No live captions:
1. Confirm microphone permission was granted.
2. Confirm backend is reachable from device network.
3. Verify backend supports the endpoints listed above.

Reader problems:
1. Test on a physical device instead of emulator when possible.
2. Confirm camera permission.
3. Retry after closing other apps that may hold camera resources.

## Development Notes

1. `translator_screen.dart` remains in the codebase but is not currently part of the visible app flow.
2. If you re-enable it later, update `home_screen.dart` and this README together.
